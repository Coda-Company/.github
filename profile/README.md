## What is Coda?

**Coda** is a groundbreaking, all-in-one platform that combines documents, spreadsheets, and applications into a single, collaborative workspace. Unlike traditional tools that force you to switch between apps, **Coda** creates a unified canvas where teams can write, plan, and automate their work. With **Coda**, you can build powerful docs that do more than just store text—they can include interactive tables, buttons, and integrations that turn static pages into living tools.

The **coda company** vision is to empower every team to build the tools they need, as easily as editing a document. Whether you're managing a project, tracking goals, or running meetings, **Coda** adapts to your workflow. Its blend of simplicity and power makes it ideal for startups, enterprises, and everything in between. By centralizing work in **Coda**, teams reduce context-switching, improve clarity, and move faster together.
